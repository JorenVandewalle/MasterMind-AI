    "## Feedback Function: `get_feedback`\n",
    "The `get_feedback` function calculates two types of feedback for a guess:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Black pegs**: These represent the number of guessed colors that are correct **and** in the correct position.\n",
    "2. **White pegs**: These represent the number of guessed colors that are correct but in the **wrong position**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "- First, we calculate the number of black pegs by comparing corresponding elements in the code and guess using `zip`.\n",
    "- Next, we calculate the white pegs by finding the minimum count of each color in the code and the guess, ensuring we donâ€™t double-count the black pegs.\n",
