# Minimax Strategy for Mastermind after Knuth's Algorithm

## Overview

After you have used Knuth's algorithm to systematically eliminate inconsistent guesses in the game of Mastermind, you can apply the **Minimax strategy** to select your next guess. The Minimax strategy aims to make a guess such that, in the worst-case scenario, you eliminate the maximum number of incorrect possibilities in subsequent guesses.

This ensures that each guess maximally reduces the search space, leading to an efficient resolution of the game with fewer guesses.

---

## Objective

- Select a guess that minimizes the worst-case number of remaining candidate codes after feedback is received.
- Maximize the number of codes eliminated based on the feedback from the game after each guess.

---

## What is the Minimax Strategy?

The **Minimax strategy** focuses on finding a guess that, for any possible feedback from the game (black and white pegs), results in the smallest number of remaining candidate codes. In other words, it aims to minimize the maximum size of the remaining search space across all possible outcomes.

### Key Concept

For a given guess \( G \):
- For every possible secret code \( S \), simulate the feedback you would get if \( G \) were guessed.
- For each feedback outcome (i.e., combinations of black and white pegs), count how many candidate codes remain consistent with that feedback.
- The goal is to find a guess where the largest number of remaining candidates is minimized.

---

## Steps for Applying the Minimax Strategy

### Step 1: Generate a Set of Candidate Codes

1. After applying Knuth's algorithm, you will have a reduced set of candidate codes that remain after eliminating inconsistent codes.
2. Let's call this set **`remaining_candidates`**.

---

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Possible Guess

1. For each candidate guess \( G \) in **`remaining_candidates`**:
    - Simulate the feedback you would get for every possible secret code \( S \).
    - For each secret code \( S \):
        - Compare \( G \) with \( S \) and determine the number of black and white pegs that would be generated.
        - Group codes based on the simulated feedback outcomes.

2. For each feedback outcome (e.g., 1 black peg, 2 white pegs):
    - Count how many codes remain in **`remaining_candidates`** after eliminating codes that do not match the simulated feedback.
    - For each possible feedback scenario, record the size of the remaining search space.

---

### Step 3: Select the Optimal Guess

- For each candidate guess \( G \):
    - Determine the largest size of the remaining search space across all possible feedback outcomes.
    - In other words, find the worst-case number of remaining codes for that guess.
  
- **Minimize this worst-case number** across all guesses. In other words, select the guess for which the worst-case number of remaining possibilities is the smallest.

---

### Step 4: Submit Your Guess and Receive Feedback

- Submit your selected guess \( G \) to the game.
- Based on the feedback received (number of black and white pegs):
    - Eliminate inconsistent codes from your search space according to the rules of the game.
    - Apply the Minimax strategy again in subsequent iterations to continue narrowing down the search space.

---

## Why Use the Minimax Strategy?

- The Minimax strategy ensures that each guess has the highest likelihood of eliminating a large portion of the search space.
- It systematically reduces the remaining candidate codes after each iteration, making the game more efficient.
- It guarantees that you eliminate as many possibilities as possible with each guess, speeding up the convergence to the secret code.

---

## Efficiency of Minimax Strategy in Mastermind

- In combination with Knuth's algorithm, the Minimax strategy:
  - Reduces the search space more rapidly by eliminating a large number of incorrect codes.
  - Minimizes the number of guesses required by ensuring that each guess maximally reduces the remaining possibilities.
  - Works efficiently in conjunction with Knuth's systematic elimination process, ensuring that the secret code is identified in a small number of guesses (at most 5 guesses).

---

## Example

Let's walk through a simple example step by step.

### Setup

- Suppose you have narrowed down the remaining candidate codes to a set of 50 possible codes after applying Knuth's algorithm.
- You need to select a guess such that, regardless of the feedback you receive, you minimize the worst-case number of remaining possibilities.

### Step 1: Evaluate a Guess `G1`

- For each secret code in **remaining_candidates**, simulate feedback for the guess `G1`.
- For each simulated feedback scenario (e.g., 1 black peg and 2 white pegs), count how many codes remain after eliminating inconsistent codes.
- Suppose, in the worst-case scenario, you end up with 10 remaining codes after using guess `G1`.

### Step 2: Evaluate Another Guess `G2`

- Similarly, simulate feedback for guess `G2`.
- In the worst-case scenario, you end up with only 6 remaining codes.
  
### Step 3: Select Optimal Guess

- Compare the worst-case results:
  - For `G1`, the worst-case remaining candidates are 10.
  - For `G2`, the worst-case remaining candidates are 6.
  
- Since 6 is the smallest worst-case number, select **guess `G2`** as your next guess.

### Step 4: Submit Guess `G2` to the Game

- Receive feedback, eliminate inconsistent codes, and continue using the Minimax strategy iteratively.

---

## Conclusion

By applying the **Minimax strategy** after Knuth's algorithm in the game of Mastermind, you systematically minimize the number of guesses required to identify the secret code. The Minimax strategy helps maximize the efficiency of each guess by ensuring that the largest search space reductions occur at every step. This combination of systematic elimination and strategic feedback evaluation makes it a powerful method for solving Mastermind optimally and quickly.
